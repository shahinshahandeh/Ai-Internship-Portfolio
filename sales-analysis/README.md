ðŸ“Š Sales Data Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from a retail dataset.
The goal is to calculate monthly sales trends and month-over-month growth percentages, then visualize the results using Python.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas â†’ for data manipulation

matplotlib â†’ for visualization

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab â†’ for running the code

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains information about customer orders, including order dates, product categories, and sales values.
For this project, we focus only on:

Order Date â†’ to track sales over time

Sales â†’ the sales amount

ðŸ”‘ Steps in the Analysis

Load and clean the dataset.

Convert dates into proper datetime format.

Group sales data by month.

Calculate month-over-month growth (%).

Visualize:

Line chart â†’ Monthly sales trend

Bar chart â†’ Growth percentage

ðŸ“Š Results

Monthly Sales Trend shows how sales change over time.

Growth % Chart highlights which months had the strongest increase or decrease.

(Example charts â€“ you should paste screenshots of your results here when you run the code)

ðŸš€ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/shahinshahandeh/sales-analysis.git


Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) in Jupyter or Google Colab.

Run the code to reproduce the analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

Add product/category level analysis.

Predict future sales using regression models.

Interactive dashboards with Plotly/Power BI.
